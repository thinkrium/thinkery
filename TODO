#things to do


#CONFIRM ACTION FORM [ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THS ACTION]

#make sure the error system is working in the model its not right now

#permissions/manage needs to set the previously set to "checked" value before rendering the view.
  the model sends the content to the database correctly.

#permissions are almost done, they view isn't linking right now

remember when deleting a user, role, or any content to delete all information in the database connecting to it

#make sure to get the sql out of controller doesn't belong

#pretty sure i locked in perms for literal non  tokenized urls

#adjust for tokenized urls

#figure out what the deal is with user_show because it only shows with no arguments but the uid 
shows accurate every time with or with arguments
