Content types

there is likely to be an install file and in the install file there will be a class and a constructor

the constructor will take in the database connection and use the injection

the constructor will create table if not exists and then content type management class will add the url and its funcitonaality to 
the url array in the controller

the controller will take it from there and do its business with sorting out its functionality
